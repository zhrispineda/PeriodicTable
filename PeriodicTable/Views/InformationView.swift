The periodic tableâ€™s arrangement also allows scientists to discern trends in element properties, including electronegativity, ionization energy, and atomic radius.")

During the next 200 years, a vast body of knowledge concerning the properties of elements and their compounds was acquired by chemists. By 1869, a total of 63 elements had been discovered. As the number of known elements grew, scientists began to recognize patterns in properties and began to develop classification schemes.")
